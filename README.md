### Hi there 👋


Howdy! I'm Alan — a full-stack software engineer with half a decade's experience in convincing computers to do what I want them to.

🧑‍💻

My background in computers can be pinpointed to getting my first Gameboy Pocket, and marvelling at how this was even possible. From there I began to spend too much time at screens, a habit that continued though my BTEC in Computing, and extended well past my time studying Software Engineering at university. This has obvious implications in my professional career, too.

Though I did take a break during the pandemic to fix guitars for a while instead. Touch grass, make music. That kinda thing. It was good fun.

My experience lies mostly with Java and Typescript (and ancilliary technologies like SQL, HTML, JS, the usual culprits) - though I'll try my hand at everything, and have dabbled in PHP, Rust, C++, and a handful of golfing languages. More recently I've grown an interest in accessibility, and how we can enable more people to interact with online experiences in the best way possible.

I guess, at my core, I'm just a developer looking to make the web a better place for everyone.
